# 🏆 EA Sports Proposal: Defensive Mastermind - Pre-Snap Player Lock System

**Target Platform:** EA Sports College Football / Madden Franchise
**Proposal Date:** May 2025
**Project Lead:** Cheick Ly

## 📝 Project Summary

This repository contains the architecture and a specific optimization module for the **Defensive Mastermind** proposal. This feature aims to introduce a new layer of skill and control for defensive players in competitive sports titles by allowing them to set a "Pre-Snap Player Lock" with defined defensive behavior modes. The accompanying code modules demonstrate both the architectural design (`DefensiveMastermindSystem`) and practical C++ optimization (`OptimizationTASK4.h`).
